# OutOut

A progressive web app (PWA) which utilises the Google Places API to find nearby bars depending on the users location. 
Created using Vue on the frontend as a PWA and NodeJS to handle the backend.

In order to get running you'll need to create a .env file in the API directory and add in "GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY" - requires your own Google Places API key.

Please use the develop branch. 

** NOT OPTIMISED FOR DESKTOP USE (yet) **
